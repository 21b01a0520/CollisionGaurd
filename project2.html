  <p>
    The objective of this project is to develop an Image Recognition System using deep learning techniques. Image recognition, also known as computer vision, is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the ability of machines to visually perceive and understand images or objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project will involve the following key components:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Building a dataset of labeled images for training the recognition model</li>
    <li>Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction</li>
    <li>Training the model to classify and recognize objects or patterns within images</li>
    <li>Utilizing pre-trained models and transfer learning for improved accuracy and efficiency</li>
    <li>Designing a user-friendly interface for uploading and processing images</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Image Recognition System will be capable of accurately identifying objects, scenes, or specific patterns within images. It will leverage deep learning algorithms to analyze image data, extract meaningful features, and make predictions based on the learned patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this project, students will gain practical experience in computer vision, deep learning, and image recognition techniques. They will learn how to preprocess and label image datasets, train and fine-tune CNN models, and create an interactive system that can effectively recognize and classify objects within images.

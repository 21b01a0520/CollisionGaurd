  <p>
    This project aims to develop a Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. A Chatbot is an AI-based software application that interacts with users through natural language conversations. NLP enables the Chatbot to understand and respond to user queries in a human-like manner.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project will involve the following key components:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Building a corpus of training data for the Chatbot</li>
    <li>Implementing NLP techniques for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization</li>
    <li>Creating an intent recognition model to identify the user's intention or query type</li>
    <li>Developing a dialogue management system to generate appropriate responses based on the user's input</li>
    <li>Incorporating machine learning algorithms for continuous learning and improvement of the Chatbot's performance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Chatbot will be designed to handle various user queries, provide relevant information, and engage in meaningful conversations. It will be trained on a diverse dataset and will employ state-of-the-art NLP techniques to enhance its understanding and response generation capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in NLP, machine learning, and chatbot development. They will learn how to preprocess textual data, build and train NLP models, and create a functional chatbot application that can assist users in real-world scenarios.
